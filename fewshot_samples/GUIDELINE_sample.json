When exercising their judgement, health \nprofessionals are expected to take this guidance fully into account, alongside the \nindividual needs, preferences and values of their patients. The application of the \nrecommendations in this guidance is at the discretion of health professionals and their \nindividual patients and do not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to \nmake decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation \nwith the patient and/or their carer or guardian. \nAll problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment \nor in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory \nAgency using the Yellow Card Scheme. \nCommissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to provide the funding required to \nenable the guidance to be applied when individual health professionals and their patients \nwish to use it, in accordance with the NHS Constitution. They should do so in light of their \nduties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance \nequality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. \nCommissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally \nsustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental \nimpact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible. \nBenralizumab for treating relapsing or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with\npolyangiitis (TA1096)\n© NICE 2025.

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and-\nconditions#notice-of-rights).\nPage 3 of\n23\n\n[第4页]\n1 Recommendations \n1.1 \nBenralizumab as an add-on to standard care can be used, within its marketing \nauthorisation, as an option to treat relapsing or refractory eosinophilic \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in adults. It can only be used if the \ncompany provides it according to the commercial arrangement. \n1.2 \nStop benralizumab after 52 weeks if the EGPA has not responded. Response is: \n• a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) score of 0, and \n• a reduction in oral corticosteroid use, either: \n－ by 50% or more since starting benralizumab, or \n－ to 7.5 mg or less per day. \n1.3 \nThis recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with benralizumab that \nwas started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having \ntreatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the \nfunding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until \nthey and their NHS healthcare professional consider it appropriate to stop. \nWhat this means in practice \nBenralizumab must be funded in the NHS in England for the condition and population \nin the recommendations, if it is considered the most suitable treatment option. \nBenralizumab must be funded in England within 90 days of final publication of this \nguidance. \nThere is enough evidence to show that benralizumab provides benefits and value for \nmoney, so it can be used routinely across the NHS in this population. \nNICE has produced tools and resources to support the implementation of this \nguidance. \nBenralizumab for treating relapsing or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with\npolyangiitis (TA1096)\n© NICE 2025.

But indirect comparisons suggest that benralizumab plus standard \ncare increases the likelihood of remission (having fewer or no symptoms of EGPA) and \nreduces relapse (having worse symptoms) compared with standard care alone. \nDespite uncertainties in the",
